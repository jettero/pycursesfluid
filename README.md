# Old Laptop vs FluidSynth (aka why not just use `______________________`)

I love fluidsynth. I love that it does its one job and that's the end of it. I
can't seem to find an interface for it that I like though. The stuff I found is
either really old and can't be run easily on modern platforms, or wants to do a
job I don't care about and have to work against, or that just don't suit me as a
person.

I like to use really modest hardware for jobs that should only really require
modest hardware.

So I have this effin' ancient laptop someone threw away. It's an eeepc from the
turn of the millenium or thereabouts.

It must be the synth for my M-Audio Hammer 88.

Synth or Bust.
